# go-tsp
**Travelling salesman problem solved with Genetic Algorithm using Go**.
  
## How to run
The program can be ran 2 ways
1. go run main.go  
or
2. go build : an executable file is generated  
**ie:** go-tsp.exe. Run the file.   

## Results
The program will create a folder called **tsp**(*can be defined in program),
 which stores the results based on the seed number provided. The results are 
 images(.png) of the tours that outperform their predecessors.  
**ie:** ./tsp/[seed number]/[images....png]

## Documentation
The program can be tweaked by modifying the global variables in 
- main.go
- geneticAlgorithm/geneticAlgBase.go
